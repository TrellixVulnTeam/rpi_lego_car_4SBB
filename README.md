# rpi_lego_car

How cool would it be to control a lego car using a really powerful motor with a raspberry pi connected through bluetooth to a PS3 controller!

Well this is exactly what this is. 
As the project stands: acceleration works fine and the connection to the pi is flawless but making the car is proving to be a bit of a pain and I had to build a motor controller from scratch to get reverse to work...
